I am an experienced programmer and highly motivated cybersecurity analyst. 
I am actively learning how to identify and analyze potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, to help protect people's information and defend against entities that wish to do harm. 
I have always had an interest in the cybersecurity field and am striving to expand my knowledge and expertise to help mitigate 
any risks that may arise from internal or external threats. 
I wish to continue to broaden my horizons in this field and put my efforts to work by helping protect any and all people or organizations that may need it.
